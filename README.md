# UKC-CO539-A2
Assignment 2 from Web Development module.

This assignment was based on JQuery and AJAX usage.
We had to create a web page that was communicating with 2 server-side scripts 
in order to retrive JSON files that we had to process.

The scripts can be accessed here:

Part 1 - Hygiene inspections publicly available on : https://ratings.food.gov.uk/
script : https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/yh/co539/A2-data/hygiene.php

Part 2 - Google Places with customer ratings about particular places in surrounding area
script : https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/yh/co539/A2-data/rating.php?

!-- Make sure to include 'business=name' in the script url, otherwise it is blank --!
eg.: https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/yh/co539/A2-data/rating.php?business=Pizza
